## What to do about broken internal links

If you have a lot of pages on your website that no longer exist, fixing them all at once can seem like a daunting task. Here are some steps you can take to quickly fix a large number of pages:

1. Identify the pages: Use a tool like Google Search Console to identify the pages on your website that are returning 404 errors.

2. Determine the best course of action: For each page that no longer exists, decide whether to redirect the page to a new URL or to remove the broken link. In some cases, you may want to create a new page to replace the deleted content.

3. Use bulk actions: If you are using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, you may be able to use bulk actions to quickly apply changes to multiple pages at once. For example, you could use a plugin like Bulk Page Editor to delete or redirect multiple pages at once.

4. Implement 301 redirects: If you choose to redirect the pages to a new URL, use a 301 redirect to let search engines know that the old URL has permanently moved to a new location.

5. Update internal links: Once you have fixed the broken pages, make sure to update any internal links on your website that were pointing to those pages.

6. Submit a sitemap: After you have made the changes, submit a new sitemap to Google Search Console to ensure that the search engine is aware of the changes and can re-crawl your website.

It's important to note that fixing a large number of pages can take time and effort, but it's worth it to maintain a healthy website and improve SEO.
