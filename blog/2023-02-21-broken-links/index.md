## What to do about broken internal links


It's important to note that fixing a large number of pages can take time and effort, but it's worth it to maintain a healthy website and improve SEO.

Broken links on a website can have a negative impact on SEO, which is why it's important to fix them. When a user clicks on a broken link, they are taken to a page that no longer exists, resulting in a poor user experience. This can also result in a high bounce rate, which is a metric that measures the percentage of visitors who leave a website after only viewing a single page.

From an SEO perspective, broken links can result in a loss of link equity. When a webpage has external links pointing to it, it gains link equity, which is a factor that search engines use to determine the authority and relevance of a webpage. However, if a webpage has broken links, it can cause search engines to view the webpage as low-quality or irrelevant, which can result in a decrease in search engine rankings.

Additionally, broken links can result in crawl errors, which can negatively impact search engine visibility. Search engines use bots to crawl websites and index their pages. If a bot encounters a broken link, it may stop crawling the website, resulting in pages not being indexed or updated in search engine results.

To address broken links, website owners should conduct regular site audits and fix any broken links that are identified. This can help to improve the user experience and maintain the authority and relevance of the website in search engine rankings.

### If you have a lot of pages on your website that no longer exist, fixing them all at once can seem like a daunting task. Here are some steps you can take to quickly fix a large number of pages:

1. Identify the pages: Use a tool like Google Search Console to identify the pages on your website that are returning 404 errors.

2. Determine the best course of action: For each page that no longer exists, decide whether to redirect the page to a new URL or to remove the broken link. In some cases, you may want to create a new page to replace the deleted content.

3. Use bulk actions: If you are using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, you may be able to use bulk actions to quickly apply changes to multiple pages at once. For example, you could use a plugin like Bulk Page Editor to delete or redirect multiple pages at once.

4. Implement 301 redirects: If you choose to redirect the pages to a new URL, use a 301 redirect to let search engines know that the old URL has permanently moved to a new location.

5. Update internal links: Once you have fixed the broken pages, make sure to update any internal links on your website that were pointing to those pages.

6. Submit a sitemap: After you have made the changes, submit a new sitemap to Google Search Console to ensure that the search engine is aware of the changes and can re-crawl your website.
