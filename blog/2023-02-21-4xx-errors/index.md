## How to fix 4XX Errors

A page that returns a 4XX status code (e.g. 404, 410, etc.) means that the page is not available on the server. Here are the steps to fix pages with returned 4XX status codes:

1. Identify the pages: Use a tool like Google Search Console or a website crawler to identify the pages on your website that are returning 4XX status codes.

2. Determine the best course of action: For each page that is returning a 4XX status code, decide whether to redirect the page to a new URL or to remove the broken link. In some cases, you may want to create a new page to replace the deleted content.

3. Implement 301 redirects: If you choose to redirect the pages to a new URL, use a 301 redirect to let search engines know that the old URL has permanently moved to a new location. This will also redirect users who try to access the old URL to the new page.

4. Update internal links: Once you have fixed the broken pages, make sure to update any internal links on your website that were pointing to those pages.

5. Submit a sitemap: After you have made the changes, submit a new sitemap to Google Search Console to ensure that the search engine is aware of the changes and can re-crawl your website.

6. Monitor for further errors: Continue to monitor your website for 4XX status codes and fix any additional errors as they arise. You can set up alerts in Google Search Console to receive notifications when new errors are detected.

By following these steps, you can quickly fix pages with returned 4XX status codes and improve your website's SEO and user experience.
